### Ball Fighter

## Game Design Document

# Introduction 

Ball Fighter is the first summative project of my second year at SAE Instiitute in games programming for the module GPR5100.
It was made by me, Paul Breuza with a huge basecode by Elias Fahran, our teacher.
The game is a C++ online multiplayer fighting game that work on a server-client architecture.

# The Game 

You incarnate a red or blue ball with a 2d side view, your goal is simple, jump on the upper part of the other player to kill him.
For that your possible action are moving right, left and jumping. you have 3 jump available until you touch the ground again.
You and your enemy are stuck in a square arena, and be carful the roof and wall will give you an impulsion to try to surpise your enemy.

# Developpement

Like I said before we started with a huge codebase, this codebase was a sort of asteroid (the game) but in duel. The server-client architecture was already there.
The firts step was to understand this code and plan what I was going to do during the next 3 weeks to advance at a regular pace.
It was the first time that we did that so I learned a lot about how to spend time planning to acually save time programming. Going step by step was also neascesary not to get lost. 
The first step of my plan was to delete all that i didn't need in the code like bullet and shooting for exemple, this step took way longer that I thought it would because of the fact that everyting in the code was linked. 
My next step was
